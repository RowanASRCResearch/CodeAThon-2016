# Rescue Manager

We are going to create a pair of applications to achieve the goal for Topic 2: Search and Rescue Applications.

We are going to create a system for managing search and rescue ships by visualizing previously searched areas as well as flags for marking points of interest. We believe that this can help search and rescue teams behave more efficiently when surveying areas.
